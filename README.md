===

This is a repo containing source files for the Fedorator.

The Fedorator is a device for writing a live image of
[Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/), the Linux distribution, onto a USB
flash drive.  It acts as a multimedia hub on Fedora booths at tech conferences
and trade shows.

This is the version that will be built on Flock.
